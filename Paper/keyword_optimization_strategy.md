# Keyword Optimization Strategy (Phase 0)

## Goal
Maximize **Discoverability (SEO)** in IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar. The Elite Prompt (Phase 0) requires 3-4 core keywords + synonyms.

## Selection Logic

### 1. "Precipitation Nowcasting" (The Task)
-   **Why**: The standard term for 0-6h betting.
-   **Search Volume**: High.
-   **Target Audience**: Meteorologists searching for specific solutions.

### 2. "ConvLSTM" (The Method)
-   **Why**: Still the most searched architecture for spatio-temporal problems.
-   **Alternative**: "Recurrent Neural Network" (Too broad).
-   **Strategy**: Catch researchers looking for *variations* of the standard baseline.

### 3. "ERA5-Land" (The Data)
-   **Why**: Rapidly growing keyword. Researchers are actively looking for *applications* of this new dataset.
-   **Strategy**: Piggyback on the popularity of the dataset itself.

### 4. "Deep Learning" (The Field)
-   **Why**: Necessary for broad categorization.
-   **Refinement**: Paired with "Spatio-Temporal Modeling" in the abstract for precision.

## Final Keyword Block
```latex
\begin{IEEEkeywords}
Precipitation Nowcasting, ConvLSTM, ERA5-Land, Deep Learning, Spatio-Temporal Modeling, Indian Monsoon
\end{IEEEkeywords}
```
*Note: "Indian Monsoon" added to capture regional relevance searches.*
