# Editor Handling Strategy (Phase 18)

## Target Journal: IEEE GRSL

## Ideal Associate Editor Profile
To avoid a "Desk Reject" or "Out of Scope" decision, we must request an Editor who understands the intersection of **Deep Learning** and **Remote Sensing** (Geoscience).

**Keywords to Look For in AE Profiles:**
-   *Machine Learning for Remote Sensing*
-   *Spatio-Temporal Data Mining*
-   *Hydrometeorology*
-   *Image Processing*

## Avoid Profiles:
-   *Pure Hydrologists*: Will complain about lack of physical mass conservation.
-   *Pure Computer Vision Theorists*: Will complain about lack of architectural novelty (ConvLSTM is "old").

## Suggested Cover Letter Request
"We respectfully request that this manuscript be handled by an Associate Editor with expertise in **Deep Learning applications for precipitation nowcasting** or **Spatio-temporal data analysis**, as the core contribution lies in the machine learning formulation applied to Earth Observation data."
