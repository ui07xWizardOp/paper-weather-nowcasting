**Title**: AI for Flash Floods: Predicting the Unpredictable in India

**The Problem**: Flash floods in India kill hundreds every year because traditional weather models are too slow (6-hour delay). Existing AI models are too big and require supercomputers that local agencies don't have.

**Our Solution**: We built "Paper Weather", a lightweight AI model that runs on a standard laptop (with a gaming GPU). It learns from 10 years of historical data to predict rainfall movement up to 6 hours ahead.

**The Breakthrough**: Most AI models predict "blurry" rain to play it safe. We taught our model to take risks and predict sharp, intense storms using a new "Weighted Loss" technique.

**The Impact**: This allows state meteorological departments to generate flood warnings in *minutes* rather than hours, potentially saving lives in vulnerable, data-sparse regions.
