# Research Timeline (Phase 12)

| Year | Milestone | Paper/Model | Relevance to Us |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2015** | **The Big Bang** | **ConvLSTM (Shi et al.)** | **Our Backbone.** Proved convolution + recurrence works for radar. |
| 2017 | Dynamic Motion | TrajGRU (Shi et al.) | Showed fixed kernels struggle with rotation (cyclones). |
| 2019 | Image-to-Image | U-Net for Weather (Agrawal et al.) | Dropped LSTM for pure CNN. Faster, but no temporal memory. |
| 2020 | Attention Enters | MetNet (Google) | Axial Attention for long horizons (12h). Too big for us. |
| **2021** | **The Dataset** | **ERA5-Land Released** | **Our Data Source.** High-res (9km) history for land. |
| 2021 | Generative Era | DGMR (DeepMind) | Solved "blurriness" with GANs. Hard to train. |
| 2023 | Foundation Models | GraphCast (DeepMind) | Global 0.25 deg model. "Solved" medium-range, but coarse for local. |
| **2024** | **The Regional Gap** | **Paper Weather (Ours)** | **Why Now?** Combining 2015 Algo + 2021 Data to fix 2023's Blindspot. |
