# Journal Compatibility Matrix (Phase 18)

| Criteria | **IEEE GRSL** | **AMS JAM** | **NeurIPS** | **NeurIPS (Climate)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Topic Fit** | **Perfect**. Focus on Remote Sensing applications. | Good. Focus on Applied Meteorology. | Poor. Focus on novel *theory*. | Good. Focus on AI+Climate. |
| **Speed** | **Fast** (< 3 months). It's a "Letter". | Slow (6-12 months). | Fixed Deadline (May). | Workshop only. |
| **Length** | **Strict (5 pages)**. Forces conciseness. | Long (20+ pages). Requires massive detail. | Strict (8 pages). | Short (4 pages). |
| **Code Requirement**| Encouraged but not mandatory. | **Mandatory** (for reproducibility). | **Mandatory** + Checklist. | Encouraged. |
| **Impact Factor** | High (~4.0). | Moderate (~3.0). | Elite (Top Tier). | N/A (Workshop). |

## Decision: IEEE GRSL
**Rationale**:
1.  **Scope**: We are applying *known methods* (ConvLSTM) to *new data* (ERA5-Land India). This is "Remote Sensing Application", not "Machine Learning Theory". NeurIPS would reject us for "lack of novelty" in architecture.
2.  **Format**: The 5-page limit forces us to cut fluff, which suits our localized study perfectly.
3.  **Speed**: We need a publication *now*, not next year.
