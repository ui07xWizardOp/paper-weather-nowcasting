\noindent \textbf{Subject: Submission of Manuscript "Deep Spatio-Temporal Nowcasting with Physically Grounded Loss Functions"}

\bigskip

\noindent Dear Editor,

\noindent We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled "\textbf{Deep Spatio-Temporal Nowcasting with Physically Grounded Loss Functions: A Case Study on the Indian Subcontinent}" for consideration in \textit{IEEE GRSL}.

\noindent \textbf{Novelty & Contribution}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We address the "blurriness" problem in deterministic nowcasting by introducing a novel \textbf{Weighted Mean Squared Error (WMSE)} loss function derived from physical precipitation thresholds (1.0 mm/hr) rather than arbitrary heuristics.
    \item We provide one of the first comprehensive benchmarks of ConvLSTM on the \textbf{ERA5-Land} dataset (2015-2025) specifically for the Indian domain, demonstrating a 12\% improvement in Critical Success Index over standard baselines.
    \item We rigorously analyze the trade-offs between "Global" foundation models (GraphCast) and "Regional" robust architectures, arguing for the continued relevance of ConvLSTMs in resource-constrained operational settings.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This work has not been published previously and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.

\bigskip

\noindent Thank you for your consideration.

\noindent Sincerely,

\noindent \textbf{The Authors} \\
